# Example using the Modular Sensors Library to Save Data to an SD card and Send data to the EnviroDIY Data Portal

This shows the use of an "EnviroDIY logger" object on a SAMD21 (Arduino Zero) board.  It is very similar to the logging_to_EnviroDIY example, except that it defines multiple hardware serial ports for the sensors that communicate with the logger using any sort of serial communication.  The SAMD boards have many more hardware serial ports available than the AVR boards, and those hardware ports should always be used before resorting to a software serial port.  The exact selection of pins and ports in this example uses the SerCom ports available on a Adafruit Feather M0.  The SerCom ports available do vary on different boards, so you must be aware of which ones are available for the board you are using.  Before using this example, you must register a site and sensors at the data portal (http://data.envirodiy.org/).  After you have registered the site and sensors, the portal will generate a registration token and universally unique identifier (UUID) for each site and further UUID's for each variable.  You will need to copy all of those UUID values into your sketch to replace the "12345678-abcd-1234-efgh-1234567890ab" place holders in this example.  Please do not try to run the example exactly as written, but delete the chunks of code pertaining to sensors that you do not have attached.
